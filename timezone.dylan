Module: time

// <timezone> represents a timezone.
define class <timezone> (<object>)
  // TODO: this is the hard one. Obviously we need the TZ data files
  // that tell us when the timezone's offset from UTC changed etc.
  // Start with naive offsets like currently used in the date library
  // and then add location-aware timezones later.
